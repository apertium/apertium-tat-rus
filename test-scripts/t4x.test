#!/bin/bash

# The purpose of this script is to make sure that transfer rules
# do the job they advertise in their headers with INPUT/OUTPUT comments.

# Supposed to be invoked by "./qa t4x"

# In particular, the program does the following:
#   * extracts all INPUT-OUTPUT statements from the TRANSFER_FILE,
#   * for each INPUT statement:
#      * runs it through the TRANSFER_MODE,
#      * checks whether the output of the TRANSFER_MODE is equal to expected
#        OUTPUT
#      * if it is, prints "<line # of INPUT> PASS: INPUT -> OUTPUT
#      * if not, prints "<line # of INPUT> FAIL: INPUT -> -(expected OUTPUT) +(actual OUTPUT)

# Here is a snippet from the actual transfer rule file which shows how the
# INPUT/OUTPUT statements look like:
# <!--
# INPUT:  ^cop-pres<VBSER>{^быть<vbser><pres><p3><sg>$}$
# OUTPUT: ""
# -->
#    <rule comment="Deletes copula in present tense which
#                   is normally ommitted in Russian.">
#      <pattern>
#        <pattern-item n="vbser-pres"/>
#      </pattern>
#      <action>
#
# NOTE: test cases might be in the rule body (either in the <rule comment=""> or
# after the <rule> tag) -- haven't decided on it and it's up to the developer.
# This script should work no matter where they are placed in the file.

# Assumes that both INPUT and OUTPUT comments are single lines and there is
# nothing before the first ^ tag except " *INPUT: *" or " *OUTPUT: *".
# You can write comments or surface forms after the last $ tag.
