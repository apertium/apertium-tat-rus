PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================

A problem with testvoc is that it takes long time to run.

We can come up with a simpler and faster testvoc which is a close approximation
of the full testvoc if we make following simplifying assumptions:
   * monodixes are trimmed;
   * there aren't any transfer rules which work selectively on lemmas;
   * SL words of particular POS correspond to words of one particular POS in TL.

The first assumption usually holds true, the second and the third are not
always the case, and we will make corresponding tweaks to our 'simple testvoc'
process later.

If we assume three things above, then testvocing one word per each paradigm
becomes a reasonable substition for the full testvoc.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS
==========================

First, we must select one word for each pardef and extract the full
paradigm of this word from the transducer.

(Note that there aren't any pardefs in a lexc dictionary, there are
lexicons. But it's useful to distinguish between two types of lexicons --
lexicons which are continuations for other lexicons, and lexicons which are
continuations for stems. Here we refer as 'pardefs' to the lexicons of the
second type.)

Of course we cannot know to which pardef a word is linked to only looking at
the (binary) transducer itself, so we provide a separate file the content of
which is similar to the following:

A1 : яхшы<adj>
N1 : мәктәп<n>
V-TV : кара<v><tv>

Then we expand the transducer with something like 'hfst-fst2sting' and search
for 'яхшы<adj>', 'мәктәп<n>' etc.
