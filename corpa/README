------

Basic workflow is like the following (IS talking to himself):
	1) run diff on tat-rus-origina.txt and corpus.rus.txt,
	2) see what is to fix/to improve,
	3) fix them and compile,
	4) run ./qa.sh tat-rus-corp to see whether you really fixed them,
	5) commit,
	6) mv tat-rus-nova.txt tat-rus-origina.txt
	
	repeat the cycle

'qa.sh tat-rus-corp' in apertium-tat-rus/ gives a coloured diff of "origina" and "nova" translations.
