* corpus.tat.txt
	Tatar translation of the 'Mary and James' story.

* corpus.rus.txt
	Russian translation of the story (does not completely match up with the Tatar
	translation, as it was translated independently).

* tat-rus-origina.txt
	Translation of corpus.tat.txt with the second to last revision of apertium-tat-rus.

* tat-rus-nova.txt
	Translation of corpus.tat.txt with the last revision of apertium-tat-rus.

* tar-rus-posted.txt
	Postedited Russian translation of the corpus.tat.txt
------

Basic workflow is like the following (IS talking to himself):
	1) mv corpus/tat-rus-nova.txt corpus/tat-rus-origina.txt
	2) run diff on tat-rus-origina.txt and tat-rus-posted.txt,
	3) see what is to fix/to improve,
	4) fix them and compile,
	5) run ./qa tat-rus-corp to see whether you really fixed them, if so
	6) commit,
	
	repeat the cycle

'qa tat-rus-corp' in apertium-tat-rus/ gives a coloured diff of "origina" and "nova" translations.
